# 11. Search Range in Binary Search Tree

## Description

Given two values k1 and k2 (where k1 < k2) and a root pointer to a Binary Search Tree. Find all the keys of tree in range k1 to k2. i.e. print all x such that k1<=x<=k2 and x is a key of given BST. Return all the keys in ascending order.

## Example

If k1 = `10` and k2 = `22`, then your function should return `[12, 20, 22]`.

```
        20
       /  \
      8   22
     / \
    4   12
```
